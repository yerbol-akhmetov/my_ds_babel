# Welcome to My Ds Babel
***

## Task
The main task is to create two functions "sql_to_csv" and "csv_to_sql" that are able to convert data from one format to another. 

## Description
The problem is solved by creation of two functions: 1) sql_to_csv function reads sql database and retrieves all data and column names, which are further written to csv string; 2) csv_to_sql function reads csv string and writes its content to sql database.

## Installation
There is no explicit installation of the project required. Running the command "python my_ds_babel.py" will execute the code.

## Usage
To use the functions, they can be copied directly from the my_ds_babel.py file, or they can be imported using import command.
